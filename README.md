Breast Cancer EDA and Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

⚡ Objective:
▪ Exploratory Data Analysis
▪ Feature Selection
▪ Building Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers
   ▪ Logistic Regression
   ▪ Random Forest
   ▪ Decision Tree
   ▪ K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   ▪ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   ▪ Naive Bayes (NB)
   ▪ XGBoost
   ▪ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

▪ Making Predictions with Classifiers
▪ Performance Analysis of the Classifiers 
▪ Classifiers Comparison


⚡ Data sources:
The Breast Cancer dataset is available in machine learning repositories maintained by the University of California, Irvine
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic

The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells
▪ 1 = Malignant (Cancerous) 212
▪ 0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) 357
▪ Missing values: none

▪ The first two columns in the dataset store "the unique ID of the samples" and "the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign)", respectively.

▪ Columns 3-32 contain 30 real-value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei:
   ▪ radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
   ▪ texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
   ▪ perimeter
   ▪ area
   ▪ smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
   ▪ compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
   ▪ concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
   ▪ concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
   ▪ symmetry
   ▪ fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
