# Breast_Cancer_EDA_Classification
Breast Cancer EDA and Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

⚡ Objective:


▪ Exploratory Data Analysis


▪ Feature Selection


▪ Building Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)


▪ Making Predictions with Classifiers


▪ Performance Analysis of the Classifiers 


▪ Classifiers Comparison


⚡ Data sources:


The Breast Cancer dataset is available in machine learning repositories maintained by the University of California, Irvine


https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic


The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells

▪ 1 = Malignant (Cancerous) 212

▪ 0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) 357

▪ Missing values: none

▪ The first two columns in the dataset store "the unique ID of the samples" and "the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign)", respectively.

▪ Columns 3-32 contain 30 real-value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei:

# radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
   
# texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
   
# perimeter
   
# area
   
# smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
   
# compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
   
# concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
   
# concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
   
# symmetry
   
# fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
