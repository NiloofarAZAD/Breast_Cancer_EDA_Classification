# Breast_Cancer_EDA_Classification
Breast Cancer EDA and Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

⚡ Objective:


🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis


🔹 Feature Selection


🔹 Building Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)


🔹 Making Predictions with Classifiers


🔹 Performance Analysis of the Classifiers 


🔹 Classifiers Comparison

⚡ Data sources:


The Breast Cancer dataset is available in machine learning repositories maintained by the University of California, Irvine


https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic


The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells

🔹 1 = Malignant (Cancerous) 212

🔹 0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) 357

🔹 Missing values: none

🔹 The first two columns in the dataset store "the unique ID of the samples" and "the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign)", respectively.

🔹 Columns 3-32 contain 30 real-value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei:

1) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
   
2) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
   
3) perimeter
   
4) area
   
5) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
   
6) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
   
7) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
   
8) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
   
9) symmetry
   
10) fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
